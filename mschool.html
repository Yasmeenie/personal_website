<h4 style="font-size:20px"><br>This is my primary school, as this picture shows.</br>
<br>I attended Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Nan Yik 'Lee Rubber' from 2010 to 2016.Chinese National Type School Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Nan Yik 'Lee Rubber' is situated in Batu 5, Jalan Gombak, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</br>
<br>My mother wanted me to learn Chinese, so I went to the Chinese school because it was close to my house. There are students from many different cultures in this school, including Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, Sabah, and Sarawakian.</h4></br>

<h4 style="background-color: #FFF8DC; style="font-size:20px"><br>This photo, as you can see, was actually shot during our science lesson. Our teacher has chosen to conduct class outside.We have a great time together, and I love how our students come to get along so well.</br>
<br>I was 12 years old at the time, and this was actually during my last year of elementary school.Actually, in our senior year, we have always conducted experiments or studied outside in order to make memories with one another.This is actually the final time my elementary school pals and I hang out together.Sincerely, I have no idea where they are these days, but we still follow one another on Facebook. We still haven't been reunited, which is sort of sad, but hopefully we can get to see my friends once again.</br>
<br>Like myself, if you are a Malaysian student who wants to attend a Chinese school but is still hesitant due to your lack of Chiniese language proficiency. You won't need to worry because the teachers will devote their lives to teaching you how to write and speak Chinese essays and converse appropriately.</br>
<br>You will become the most intelligent and diligent students if you attended any Chinese school, I can assure you of that.This is a result of the teachers' eagerness to assign homework each day, which they then monitor the next day to see if all students have completed it. In order to prevent laziness in the future, students who fail to complete their homework will be automatically punished. Compared to other schools, Chinese schools undoubtedly have the strictest regulations.</br>
<br>My first attempt at cheating on a spelling assignment is the Chinese school experience that I remember the most.However, after I was discovered by my teachers, I was informed that I would receive a small penalty. Instead, the teacher advised me to go to the principal's office and accept my error. When I met with the principal, I was really afraid, but happily, she was understanding and advised me not to repeat the mistake.For me, that was the most traumatising day I had in elementary school.
I have never cheated on an exam and I have never skipped assigned assignments.</br></h4>

<hr>
<br><h4 style="font-size:20px">I had the best time in elementary school because I didn't have any poisonous pals or bigoted people from a different culture. All you really need to do, in my opinion, is be kind to everyone such as friends, teachers, cafeteria employees, cleaner and others. As a result, you may enjoy your time in school.</br></h4>
